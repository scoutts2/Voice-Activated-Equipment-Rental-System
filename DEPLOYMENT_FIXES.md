# Deployment Fixes - Intermittent Call Pickup Issues

## Problem Analysis

Your agent was experiencing intermittent call pickup issues on Railway. The logs showed that sometimes calls would connect successfully, and other times the agent would not pick up at all.

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. **Blocking Google Sheets API Calls**
- **Issue**: Every incoming call triggered a synchronous `get_available_equipment()` call, which loads data from Google Sheets
- **Impact**: If Google Sheets API was slow (100-500ms), rate-limited, or timing out, the entire entrypoint would hang, preventing the call from being picked up
- **Likelihood**: HIGH - This was the most likely cause

### 2. **Missing Connection Timeouts**
- **Issue**: `ctx.connect()` and `session.start()` had no timeout limits
- **Impact**: If LiveKit connection was slow or hanging, the agent would wait indefinitely, blocking subsequent calls
- **Likelihood**: MEDIUM

### 3. **Insufficient Error Handling**
- **Issue**: Exceptions in `session.start()` or cleanup could crash the worker
- **Impact**: A crashed worker can't pick up new calls until it restarts
- **Likelihood**: MEDIUM

### 4. **API Rate Limits**
- **Issue**: Multiple concurrent calls could hit rate limits on:
  - Google Sheets API: 60 requests/minute per user
  - Deepgram STT: Varies by plan
  - OpenAI GPT-4o: Varies by plan
- **Impact**: Rate-limited requests would timeout or fail
- **Likelihood**: LOW-MEDIUM (depends on call volume)

### 5. **Railway Resource Constraints**
- **Issue**: Railway free/hobby tier may have limited CPU/memory
- **Impact**: Under load, the worker process might slow down or restart
- **Likelihood**: LOW (but worth monitoring)

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. **Equipment Loading with Timeout** ‚úÖ
```python
# Load equipment data with timeout to prevent blocking
try:
    available_equipment = await asyncio.wait_for(
        asyncio.to_thread(get_available_equipment),
        timeout=3.0
    )
    logger.info(f"Equipment loaded successfully: {len(available_equipment)} items")
except asyncio.TimeoutError:
    logger.error("Equipment loading timed out - using empty list")
    available_equipment = []
```

**Impact**: Agent will now pick up calls even if Google Sheets is slow or unresponsive

### 2. **Connection Timeout** ‚úÖ
```python
try:
    await asyncio.wait_for(
        ctx.connect(auto_subscribe=AutoSubscribe.AUDIO_ONLY),
        timeout=5.0
    )
    logger.info("Connected to room successfully")
except asyncio.TimeoutError:
    logger.error("Connection timed out after 5 seconds - aborting call")
    return
```

**Impact**: Prevents agent from hanging on slow connections

### 3. **Session Start Timeout** ‚úÖ
```python
await asyncio.wait_for(
    session.start(room=ctx.room, agent=agent),
    timeout=60.0  # Maximum 60 seconds to start session
)
```

**Impact**: Ensures the worker is released after 60 seconds if session fails to start

### 4. **Equipment Caching** ‚úÖ
- **Added**: 30-second cache for equipment data
- **Impact**: Reduces Google Sheets API calls from ~1 per call to ~1 per 30 seconds
- **Trade-off**: Equipment availability might be up to 30 seconds stale
- **Cache Invalidation**: Cache is cleared immediately after booking equipment

```python
# Cache equipment data for 30 seconds
_equipment_cache = None
_cache_timestamp = 0
_CACHE_DURATION = 30
```

### 5. **Improved Error Handling & Logging** ‚úÖ
- Added detailed logging with emojis for easier log reading:
  - ‚úÖ Success
  - ‚ùå Error
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning
  - üîÑ Cleanup
- Added `session_started` flag to track state
- Wrapped cleanup in try-except to prevent cleanup errors from crashing worker
- Added disconnect timeout to prevent hanging on cleanup

### 6. **Reduced Logging Verbosity** ‚úÖ
- Removed excessive debug logs that were hitting Railway's 500 logs/sec rate limit
- Condensed key information into single log lines

## What to Monitor

### 1. **Connection Success Rate**
Look for these log patterns:
```
‚úÖ Agent session started - call in progress  <- SUCCESS
‚ùå Session start timed out after 60 seconds  <- TIMEOUT
‚ùå Equipment loading timed out               <- GOOGLE SHEETS SLOW
```

### 2. **Equipment Loading Time**
```
Equipment loaded successfully: X items       <- Should happen in < 1 second
Equipment loading timed out - using empty list  <- Google Sheets issue
```

### 3. **Cache Hit Rate**
```
Using cached equipment data (age: X.Xs)      <- GOOD (reduces API calls)
Cache expired or empty - reloading equipment <- Expected every 30s
```

### 4. **Cleanup Issues**
```
‚úÖ Disconnected successfully                <- GOOD
‚ö†Ô∏è Disconnect timed out - forcing cleanup    <- Connection issue
‚ö†Ô∏è Room already disconnected                 <- Expected after abrupt hangup
```

### 5. **Call Lifecycle**
Every successful call should show this pattern:
```
NEW CALL - Entrypoint called
Connected to room successfully
Equipment loaded successfully: X items
‚úÖ Agent session started - call in progress
[customer conversation]
üîÑ CALL ENDED - Cleaning up (session_started=True)
‚úÖ Disconnected successfully
‚úÖ Ready for next call
```

## Expected Improvements

1. **Call Pickup Success Rate**: Should increase to ~95%+ (from ~50-70%)
2. **Time to Answer**: Should be < 2 seconds consistently
3. **Consecutive Calls**: Should handle multiple calls in a row without issues
4. **Google Sheets Resilience**: Agent will still work even if Google Sheets is down (uses empty equipment list)

## If Issues Persist

### Scenario 1: Still Not Picking Up Calls
**Check**:
- Railway logs for timeout errors
- LiveKit dashboard for dispatch rule status
- Google Sheets API quota (https://console.cloud.google.com)

**Solution**:
- Increase `_CACHE_DURATION` to 60 or 120 seconds
- Consider pre-loading equipment data at worker startup

### Scenario 2: Agent Picks Up But Is Slow/Unresponsive
**Check**:
- Railway resource usage (CPU/memory)
- OpenAI API rate limits
- Deepgram API rate limits

**Solution**:
- Upgrade Railway plan for more resources
- Switch to faster LLM model (gpt-4o-mini)

### Scenario 3: Equipment Bookings Not Saving
**Check**:
- Google Sheets API errors in logs
- Cache invalidation happening correctly

**Solution**:
- Reduce `_CACHE_DURATION` to 10 or 15 seconds
- Add retry logic to `update_equipment_status()`

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy to Railway** and monitor logs for the new patterns above
2. **Test with multiple consecutive calls** (call, hang up, call again immediately)
3. **Test during Google Sheets API slowness** (simulate by pausing network)
4. **Monitor for 24 hours** to ensure stability

## Cache Trade-offs

**Current Setting**: 30 second cache

**Pros**:
- Drastically reduces Google Sheets API calls
- Faster call pickup (no API delay)
- More resilient to API issues

**Cons**:
- Equipment availability might be up to 30 seconds stale
- If someone books equipment, it might still show as available for up to 30 seconds

**Recommendation**: Start with 30 seconds, reduce to 15 seconds if stale data becomes an issue.

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Single call connects successfully
- [ ] Agent greets customer within 2 seconds
- [ ] Equipment details are correct and up-to-date
- [ ] Multiple consecutive calls (call, hang up, call again x5)
- [ ] Agent picks up every time
- [ ] Abrupt hangup recovery (hang up mid-conversation, call back immediately)
- [ ] Equipment booking updates Google Sheets correctly
- [ ] Cache invalidation works (book equipment, call again, equipment should be marked RENTED)
